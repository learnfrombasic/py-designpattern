## Learning Design Patterns in Python

Welcome to **Py-DesignPattern**, a hands-on exploration of software design patterns using Python. This repository serves as a personal review space for mastering design patterns while keeping the examples relevant through the lens of a **coffee shop** context. Every pattern will be demonstrated using real-world coffee shop scenarios to make learning more intuitive and practical.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're a Python developer looking to strengthen your understanding of design patterns, this repository is for you. Each pattern includes a concise explanation and an implementation in Python.

### 📌 Design Pattern Categories

#### 🏗️ Creational Patterns (How objects are created)

> Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [ ] **[Singleton](./singleton)** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
- [ ] **[Factory](./factory)** - Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [ ] **[Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory)** - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
- [ ] **[Prototype](./prototype)** - Creates objects based on a prototype instance, avoiding costly creation.
- [ ] **[Builder](./builder/)** - Constructs complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation.

#### 🏛️ Structural Patterns (How objects are composed)

> Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [ ] **[Adapter](./adapter)** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- [ ] **[Bridge](./bridge)** - Decouples abstraction from implementation.
- [ ] **[Composite](./composite)** - Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- [ ] **[Decorator](./decorator)** - Dynamically adds behavior to objects.

#### 🔄 Behavioral Patterns (How objects interact)

> Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [ ] **[Observer](./observer)** - Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes, its dependents are notified.
- [ ] **[Strategy](./strategy)** - Defines a family of algorithms and lets them be interchangeable.
- [ ] **[Command](./command)** - Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing undoable operations.
- [ ] **[State](./state)** - Allows an object to change behavior when its internal state changes.
